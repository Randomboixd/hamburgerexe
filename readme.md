# üçî.exe


Hamburger.exe is a weird game i made in one and half days... (its also my first )

# How to play

Move with W A S D, or with arrow keys. Interact with E.

Eat hamburgers, use the toilet to keep the meter below 10.

Simple enoguh, yet if you're not a PrO GaEmR might be hard.

# Compiling

On windows, make a virtual env and activate it,
## Important: Dependencies
- `pip install requests`

in powershell you can run `compile.ps1` and make an executable... That should be it!

On linux... i didn't test the game yet. you caaan make a build however im not sure how it will end...
