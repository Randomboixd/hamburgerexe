# üçî.exe


Hamburger.exe is a weird game i made in one and half days... (its also my first)

# How to play

Move with W A S D, or with arrow keys. Interact with E.

Eat hamburgers, use the toilet to keep the meter below 10.

Simple enoguh, yet if you're not a PrO GaEmR it might be hard.

# Compiling

On windows, make a virtual env and activate it.

Then run compile.ps1

On linux... i didn't test the game yet.
However we got a build script for it.

Just make sure you're in a virtualenv and run compile.sh
